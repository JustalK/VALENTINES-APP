# My Sweet Diane

What is the best way to saying you love someone for a developer ? Creating an app ! Yes, I created an entire app for the valentine day because I know for sure nobody never gave that to my wife. It's unique and represent the developer that I am so well. For also making some personal improvement, I decided to use a new technology that I did not nothing about `Flutter`. I learnt everything I could about `Dart` and `Flutter` in a month.
